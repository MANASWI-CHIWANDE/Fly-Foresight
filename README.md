# Fly Foresight - Flight Price Prediction Model


## Overview

Fly Foresight is a flight price prediction model developed using Python. The model utilizes the powerful RandomForest algorithm to predict flight prices with an impressive accuracy of 82%. The dataset used for training the model includes datetime features extracted using the datetime library.

This repository contains the source code for the flight price prediction model as well as a web application built using Flask, allowing users to interact with the model and get flight price predictions for their desired routes and dates.

## Features

- Flight price prediction using RandomForest algorithm
- Extensive use of the datetime library to extract features from datetime objects
- Interactive web application using Flask
- RESTful API for flight price prediction
- Android app integration for easy price predictions on mobile devices
